      <h1> A (Biased) Unbiased Ranking Of Stardew Valley's Bachelors and Bachelorettes </h1>
      <header>
         <article>
         <p> Stardew Valley is one of the (many reasons) I want to learn to code. Created by just <em>one dude</em> (AKA ConcernedApe),
            it's jam packed with great storytelling, pretty visuals, intrigue, drama, action, combat, sus- okay, okay,
            back on track. The game also allows players to form friendships and even relationships with its marriageble
            characters. Below is my completely unbiased and fair ranking of those characters based on the <b> hours</b>
            I've spent playing. If you don't care what I have to say, and just wanna see where your fave ended up, click
            their name below.
         <ul>
            <li>Abigail</li>
            <li>Alex</li>
            <li>Elliot</li>
            <li>Emily</li>
            <li>Haley</li>
            <li>Harvey</li>
            <li>Leah</li>
            <li>Maru</li>
            <li>Penny</li>
            <li>Sam</li>
            <li>Sebastian</li>
            <li>Shane</li>

         </ul>

         <h2>Alex, Sam, &amp Penny</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8pk84mzo75soyr/Alex-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Alex><img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlspt7ucgixivu7/Sam-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1", alt = Sam><img src ="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dysr0lwm9v8ipn/Penny-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Penny>
         <p>Tied for last, we have Alex, Sam, and Penny. Every time I play, I see Alex and Sam and think <em>who are you
               again?</em> I completely wrote out this list before I realized I had forgotten to rank Penny (sorry
               ).
         </p>
         <h2>Haley &amp Shane</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufs01tg1w993rqm/Haley-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt ="Haley Portrait"> <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a36ggwheo6tactt/Shane-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = "Shane">
         <p>Another tie… When you interact with these two, you’ll probably think <em>Oh, I can fix them. </em>You can’t.
            They’re mean, rude, and better left as friends. You deserve better, bestie.
         </p>
         <h2>Maru</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/3nzvwg3vcl9hck9/Maru-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Maru >
         <p>It’s not you… it’s your dad. Once you begin to gain hearts with Maru, her dad, Demetrius, will warn you to
            stay away from her because she’s a ‘good girl’ with a ‘bright future’. Instant ick!
         </p>
         <h2>Harvey</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrpv5mb4fr6xf3z/Harvey-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Harvey>
         <p>Harvey would rank soooo much higher except for one detail. If you marry him, he still charges you for
            medical attention…EXCUSE ME? I’m your spouse, shouldn’t I get a bit of special treatment?? Shouldn’t I at
            least be covered by your insurance???</p>
         <h2>Sebastian</h2>
         <img src ="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvowe62i5752tyd/Sebastian-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Sebastian>
         <p>Sebastian is a freelance programmer (wonder if he took LC101). He’s emo and broody which is cool to an
            extent, but even after marriage, he can be standoffish and the “I’m so misunderstood” schtick gets old
            quickly.
         </p>
         <h2>Abigail</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ffhkr4yqbz1gin/Abigail.webp?raw=1" alt = Abigail>
         <p>She’s fun, quirky, and hunts ghosts. There is also an error in the code that makes her eat rocks. Fans loved
            the mistake so much that ConcernedApe never patched it. A girl that will look at quartz and think <em> YUM
            </em> is a catch in my eyes.
         </p>
         <h2>Emily</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/aawuor6g79wzrv1/Emily-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt= Emily>
         <p>If you marry her, you get a pet parrot. Enough said. </p>
         <h2>Elliot</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqg76vip7ilmo7j/Elliott-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Elliot>
         <p>Want a man that writes poetry, lives beachside in a ramshackle shed, and gazes wistfully out at the sea for
            hours at a time? Elliot is for you. He can be a bit…intense and pretentious to say the least, but the
            English major in me loves him.
         </p>
         <h2>Leah</h2>
         <img src = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/rv1uuegz3wtl3ky/Leah-Portrait_192px.webp?raw=1" alt = Leah>
         <p>I love Leah so much that I have to stop myself from marrying her in every save of Stardew…It’s a problem.
            She’s an artist (at one point she’ll even gift you with a sculpture she carves for you), sweet, and once
            married, is super helpful around the farm. Her backstory is also chock full of DRAMA, and you are put right
            in the middle of it.
